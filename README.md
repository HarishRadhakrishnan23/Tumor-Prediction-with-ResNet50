## Introduction

Heart tumors are rare but can be life-threatening if not detected early. This project aims to provide a systematic approach for identifying patterns in the data that may signal the presence of heart tumors. The provided notebook walks through the data analysis and modeling process to help in tumor detection.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature selection, and scaling.
- **Visualization:** Graphical representation of important features and correlations.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of various algorithms to predict outcomes.
- **Evaluation:** Model performance metrics including accuracy, precision, and recall.
